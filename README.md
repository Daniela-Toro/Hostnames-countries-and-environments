# 🖥️ Random Hostname Generator & Analysis with Advanced Python 🧑‍💻

## Project Overview 🎯
This project is a training project for a Master's program, designed by a professor at **Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)**. It focuses on generating random hostnames using Python and performing analysis on the generated hostnames. It leverages various Python libraries to generate, manipulate, and analyze random hostnames. The analysis includes visualizations, distributions, and other Python techniques to detect patterns in the generated data.

## 📚 Key Features & Tools
- **Random Hostname Generation 💻**: Using Python to generate random hostnames based on configurable parameters such as length, characters, and patterns.
- **Data Analysis 🔍**: Utilizing Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to analyze and manipulate the generated data.
- **Data Visualizations 📊**: Using Matplotlib and other tools to create visual representations of hostname data, such as length distributions and frequency analysis.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📈
- Random library for generating random values 🎲

## 🛠️ How it Works
The project consists of two main components:
1. **Random Hostname Generation**: The script generates random hostnames based on configurable rules, including:
   - Length of the hostname (e.g., 8 characters, 12 characters, etc.)
   - Use of alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) and special characters
   - Customizable patterns (e.g., starting with a letter, ending with digits)
   
2. **Analysis and Insights**: Once the random hostnames are generated, they are analyzed using advanced Python techniques:
   - Data analysis to check the randomness and distribution of generated hostnames
   - Visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, etc.) to illustrate key trends in the data
